In digital systems, an identity usually encompasses: Usernames or IDs: Unique identifiers assigned to users. Attributes: Information related to the user, such as their name, email address, roles, and permissions. Credentials: Data that the user provides to prove their identity, such as passwords, biometric data, or security tokens. Identity is the foundation for establishing who is who in a digital system. Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the person or system accessing the resources is who they claim to be. There are various methods of authentication: Password-Based Authentication: The user provides a username and password. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): The user provides two or more verification methods, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their phone. Biometric Authentication: The user provides a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Token-Based Authentication: The user provides a security token, which is often a generated string or a physical device. Authentication answers the question: \"Are you who you say you are?\" Authorization Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Once the system knows who the user is (via authentication), it checks the user's permissions to grant or deny access to specific resources or actions. Authorization mechanisms include: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles, and permissions are assigned to those roles. Access Control Lists (ACLs): Specific permissions are assigned to users or groups for various resources. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC): Policies define the conditions under which access is granted. Authorization answers the question: \"What are you allowed to do?\" Summary Identity: Establishes who a user or entity is. Authentication: Verifies that the user or entity is who they claim to be.

It is designed to help organizations manage and secure their digital identities and resources. Key features and functions of Azure Entra ID include: Identity Management: Manages user identities and ensures secure authentication and authorization. Access Management: Controls access to applications and resources within the organization. Single Sign-On (SSO): Allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enhances security by requiring two or more verification methods. Conditional Access: Provides policies to enforce specific requirements for accessing resources. Self-Service Password Reset: Enables users to reset their passwords without IT assistance. B2B Collaboration: Allows secure collaboration with external partners by granting them access to internal resources. B2C Identity Management: Manages customer identities for applications. Application Management: Integrates with a wide range of applications for streamlined access and management. Azure Entra ID is a critical component for securing and managing access to Microsoft services and other integrated applications, making it an essential tool for enterprises leveraging Microsoft cloud solutions. Azure Active Directory Microsoft Entra is a product family that includes Azure AD/Microsoft Entra Id Active Directory (AD) is not the same as Azure AD/ Microsoft Entra ID Every Azure account will have an Azure AD/Entra ID service A tenant is a dedicated instance of Azure AD/Entra ID. It represents your organization in Azure A user can only be a member of up to 500 tenants A subscription is a billin entity. All resources can only belong to a single subscription. Azure AD/Entra ID is the identity, authorization, and management service buildt in to Azure. Zero Trust Concepts All users assumed untrustworthy unless proven otherwise Trusted by identity Regardless of location (trusted/untrusted networks) Least priviledge access - just enough permissions to perform the job Simplified, centralized mamagement Zero Trust = No presumed trust, but idemtities can be validated. No trusted locations. Multi-Factor Authenticatin Multi-factor authentication provides layered security for user identity. It requires at least two components of: Something you know Someting you have Something you are MFA is a recommended security feature by Microsoft for all Microsoft identities. Conditional Access Conditional Access is a feature that provides an additional layer of security to your environments and identities. Conditional Access rules are essentially if/then statements that permit or deny access depending on whether the rules are met. Multi-factor authentication os pften impelmented with Conditional Access as further security. Microsoft recommends the use of MFA and Conditional Access Passwordless Authentication Increase convenience while staying secure Remove password from login and replace with: Something you have (phone/key fob) Something you know/are (on device) Fingerprint/Face unlock External Guest Access External guest access enables security outside of your organizational boundaries . Provides visibility of external guest activity within your organizational IT borders. Business-to-business (B2B) access provides a federated level of trust for tenants .

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Definition : A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. Explanation : This principle advocates for separating different concerns into distinct classes, making the system more modular and easier to manage. When a class has only one responsibility, it's easier to understand and modify without affecting other parts of the system. Further Reading : Single Responsibility Principle on Baeldung SRP by Robert C. Martin 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Definition : Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This is often achieved through polymorphism, where new functionalities can be added by creating new classes that inherit from existing ones. Further Reading : Open/Closed Principle on Baeldung OCP by Robert C. Martin 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, managing the lifecycle of containers across a cluster of machines. How Kubernetes Works Kubernetes orchestrates containers across multiple hosts, providing a unified interface for managing them. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers and operators to focus on application logic and policies rather than the specifics of the environment. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works: Containers and Pods: Container: A lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software package that includes the application code and all its dependencies. Pod: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can consist of one or more containers. Containers in the same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other easily. Nodes and Clusters: Node: A worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be either a physical or virtual machine. Each Node runs at least one container runtime (like Docker) and the necessary Kubernetes components. Cluster: A set of Nodes that Kubernetes manages. The cluster is the environment where your applications run. Control Plane: API Server: The core of Kubernetes' control plane, it exposes the Kubernetes API and is the entry point for all administrative tasks. Scheduler: Watches for new Pods with no assigned Node and assigns them to a Node based on resource requirements and policies. Controller Manager: A daemon that runs various controllers to handle routine tasks like scaling, rolling updates, and health checks. etcd: A key-value store that Kubernetes uses to store all cluster data. It acts as the brain of Kubernetes, keeping track of the state of the cluster. Kubelet: An agent that runs on each Node. It ensures that containers are running in a Pod and communicates with the Kubernetes API server. Kube-Proxy: A network proxy that runs on each Node, managing networking rules for Pods and providing service discovery and load balancing. Container Runtime: The software responsible for running the containers. While Docker is a common runtime, Kubernetes supports other runtimes such as containerd and CRI-O. Reasons to Use Kubernetes Scalability: Automatically scale your applications up and down based on demand. Portability: Run applications in a consistent environment across different environments like on-premises, public, or private cloud. Resilience: Kubernetes automatically replaces or reschedules containers when they fail, maintaining the desired state of your applications. Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks: Safely roll out changes to your application or configuration and roll back in case of failure. Efficient Resource Utilization: Kubernetes packs containers efficiently onto your Nodes, optimizing resource use. Self-Healing: Automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules them, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they're ready to serve. Kubernetes Architecture Overview Here's a high-level overview of the Kubernetes architecture: Master Node (Control Plane): API Server: Handles all RESTful requests to manage the cluster (e.g., deployments, scaling, etc.). Scheduler: Assigns workloads to Nodes based on resource availability. Controller Manager: Manages controllers, which enforce the desired state of the cluster. etcd: Stores all data needed to manage the cluster. Worker Nodes: Kubelet: Communicates with the API Server and manages the containers running on the Node. Kube-Proxy: Handles networking for Pods running on the Node. Container Runtime: Pulls and runs container images. Objects: Pods: The basic deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can run one or more containers. Services: Abstracts the networking in Kubernetes, providing a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of Pods. Deployments: Provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets (which ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time). ConfigMaps/Secrets: Manage configuration data separately from container images. Networking: Kubernetes abstracts away the complexities of networking. Pods can communicate with each other across Nodes, and Services provide a unified interface for accessing Pods. Conclusion Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration tool that helps you manage containerized applications at scale. It automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling applications, providing a resilient, portable, and flexible environment for running modern, cloud-native applications. Its architecture, based on a master-worker model, ensures that applications run efficiently and reliably across different environments.

The cluster consists of one master node and two worker nodes. This setup is ideal for learning Kubernetes, testing, and small-scale deployments. 1. Setup GCP Infrastructure Setting up the infrastructure on GCP is the foundation of your Kubernetes cluster. This involves creating virtual machines (VMs) that will serve as the nodes in your cluster. Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, is used to automate the creation and management of these resources, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and ease of modification. Step 1: Initialize Terraform Initialize Terraform to download necessary plugins and prepare your working directory: bash Copy code terraform init terraform plan terraform apply -auto-approve terraform output > terraform-outputs.txt This command sequence initializes Terraform, generates an execution plan, applies the plan to create resources, and then saves the outputs (such as VM IP addresses) to a file for later use. 2. Install Kubernetes Components Step 1: SSH into Each VM SSH into each VM created by Terraform to install necessary components. Use the VM names from terraform-outputs.txt: bash Copy code gcloud compute ssh --zone \"europe-west6-a\" \"k8s-master\" --project \"codify-playground-yannick\" gcloud compute ssh --zone \"europe-west6-a\" \"k8s-worker-1\" --project \"codify-playground-yannick\" gcloud compute ssh --zone \"europe-west6-a\" \"k8s-worker-2\" --project \"codify-playground-yannick\" Step 2: Install containerd We will install containerd, which is the preferred container runtime for Kubernetes. Load Kernel Modules Ensure that necessary kernel modules are loaded: bash Copy code cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf overlay br_netfilter EOF sudo modprobe overlay sudo modprobe br_netfilter Configure Sysctl Parameters Configure sysctl parameters to meet Kubernetes networking requirements: bash Copy code cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 EOF Apply the sysctl parameters without rebooting: sudo sysctl --system These steps enable IP forwarding and ensure that bridged network traffic is properly processed by iptables. Download and Install containerd Download the containerd binaries and extract them to /usr/local: bash Copy code wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v1.7.11/containerd-1.7.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local containerd-1.7.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz Configure and Enable containerd Service Generate the default configuration for containerd: bash Copy code sudo mkdir /etc/containerd containerd config default > config.toml sudo cp config.toml /etc/containerd Download the systemd service file for containerd, enable the service, and start it: bash Copy code wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/main/containerd.service sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/ sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable --now containerd Verify that containerd is running: bash Copy code sudo systemctl status containerd Step 3: Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl Install the necessary Kubernetes components on all VMs (master and worker nodes): bash Copy code sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet Step 4: Install runc While containerd is the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), runc is the actual runtime used by containerd. Install it as follows: bash Copy code wget https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.1.10/runc.amd64 sudo install -m 755 runc.amd64 /usr/local/sbin/runc Step 5: Install CNI Plugin for containerd containerd requires a CNI plugin to manage network interfaces. Install the CNI plugins: bash Copy code wget https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.4.0/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.4.0.tgz sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin sudo tar Cxzvf /opt/cni/bin cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.4.0.tgz Step 6: Configure containerd with Systemd Cgroup Driver To ensure compatibility with Kubernetes, configure the systemd cgroup driver in the /etc/containerd/config.toml file. Set SystemdCgroup to true: bash Copy code sudo vim /etc/containerd/config.toml Locate the following section and update it: toml Copy code [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.runc] ... [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.runc.options] SystemdCgroup = true After updating, restart containerd: bash Copy code sudo systemctl restart containerd sudo systemctl status containerd Step 7: Disable Swap Kubernetes requires swap to be disabled: bash Copy code sudo swapoff -a 3. Initialize the Kubernetes Control Plane Step 1: Initialize the Control Plane Initialize the Kubernetes control plane on the k8s-master node: bash Copy code sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 This command sets up the control plane components (API server, scheduler, and controller manager) and configures the network with the specified CIDR range for pods. Step 2: Configure kubectl for the Master Node Set up kubectl to manage the cluster from the master node: bash Copy code mkdir -p $HOME/.kube sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config Step 3: Enable Shell Completion for kubectl For a better command-line experience, enable shell completion for kubectl: bash Copy code echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc source <(kubectl completion bash) 4. Join Worker Nodes to the Cluster Step 1: Retrieve the Join Command After initializing the control plane, retrieve the kubeadm join command to add worker nodes to the cluster: bash Copy code kubeadm token create --print-join-command Step 2: Join Worker Nodes SSH into each worker node (k8s-worker-1 and k8s-worker-2) and run the kubeadm join command: bash Copy code sudo kubeadm join :6443 --token --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256: Replace , , and with the actual values from the kubeadm join command. 5. Deploy a Pod Network Step 1: Install a Pod Network Add-On To enable communication between pods across different nodes, install a pod network add-on. Option 1: Flannel bash Copy code kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml Wait a few moments for the network to be deployed across all nodes.

This involves creating virtual machines (VMs) that will serve as the nodes in your cluster. Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, is used to automate the creation and management of these resources, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and ease of modification. Step 1: Initialize Terraform Initialize Terraform to download necessary plugins and prepare your working directory: bash Copy code terraform init terraform plan terraform apply -auto-approve terraform output > terraform-outputs.txt This command sequence initializes Terraform, generates an execution plan, applies the plan to create resources, and then saves the outputs (such as VM IP addresses) to a file for later use.","title":"1.
