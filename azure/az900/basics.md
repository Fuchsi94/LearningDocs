## Identity

Identity refers to the information about an individual or entity that is used to uniquely identify them. In digital systems, an identity usually encompasses:

- Usernames or IDs: Unique identifiers assigned to users.
- Attributes: Information related to the user, such as their name, email address, roles, and permissions.
- Credentials: Data that the user provides to prove their identity, such as passwords, biometric data, or security tokens.
  **Identity is the foundation for establishing who is who in a digital system.**

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the person or system accessing the resources is who they claim to be. There are various methods of authentication:

- Password-Based Authentication: The user provides a username and password.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): The user provides two or more verification methods, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their phone.
- Biometric Authentication: The user provides a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition.
- Token-Based Authentication: The user provides a security token, which is often a generated string or a physical device.
  **Authentication answers the question: "Are you who you say you are?"**

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Once the system knows who the user is (via authentication), it checks the user's permissions to grant or deny access to specific resources or actions. Authorization mechanisms include:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles, and permissions are assigned to those roles.
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): Specific permissions are assigned to users or groups for various resources.
- Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC): Policies define the conditions under which access is granted.
  **Authorization answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"**

## Summary

- Identity: Establishes who a user or entity is.
- Authentication: Verifies that the user or entity is who they claim to be.
- Authorization: Determines what the authenticated user or entity is allowed to do within the system.
