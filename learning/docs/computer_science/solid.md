# Overview of SOLID Principles for Software Development

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented software development that help developers create systems that are more maintainable, scalable, and flexible. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob." Here's a breakdown of each principle along with a brief explanation and relevant links for further reading:

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
- **Explanation**: This principle advocates for separating different concerns into distinct classes, making the system more modular and easier to manage. When a class has only one responsibility, it's easier to understand and modify without affecting other parts of the system.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Explanation**: This principle promotes writing code that can be extended without changing its existing behavior. This is often achieved through polymorphism, where new functionalities can be added by creating new classes that inherit from existing ones.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Explanation: This principle ensures that a derived class can be used in place of its base class without causing unexpected behavior. It emphasizes the importance of inheritance hierarchies where derived classes extend the base class without changing its fundamental behavior.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Explanation**: This principle advises against creating large, monolithic interfaces. Instead, it encourages creating smaller, more specific interfaces that clients can implement as needed. This results in more modular and flexible code.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
- **Explanation**: This principle promotes the decoupling of software components by relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain, as changes to low-level components do not affect high-level components.
